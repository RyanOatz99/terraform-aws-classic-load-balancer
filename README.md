Terraform AWS Base Networking
=============================

A Terraform module for building a base network in AWS.

The network consists of:
* Public and private subnets for each supplied availability zone
* A NAT gateway for outbound Internet connectivity
* Routes from the public subnets to the Internet gateway
* Routes from the private subnets to the NAT
* A bastion host configured with the supplied SSH key
* A security group for the bastion limited to the supplied IP ranges
* A DNS entry in the supplied public zone for the bastion
* Standard tags for all resources

Usage
-----

To use the module, include something like the following in your terraform configuration:

```hcl-terraform
module "base-network" {
  source = "git@github.com:tobyclemson/terraform-aws-base-networking.git//src"
  
  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  region = "eu-west-2"
  availability_zones = "eu-west-2a,eu-west-2b"
  
  component = "important-component"
  deployment_identifier = "production"
  
  bastion_ami = "ami-bb373ddf"
  bastion_ssh_public_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  bastion_ssh_allow_cidrs = "100.10.10.0/24,200.20.0.0/16"
  
  domain_name = "example.com"
  public_zone_id = "Z1WA3EVJBXSQ2V"
}
```

Executing `terraform get` will fetch the module.

Development
-----------

### Machine Requirements

In order for the build to run correctly, a few tools will need to be installed on your
development machine:

* Ruby (2.3.1)
* Bundler
* git
* git-crypt
* gnupg
* direnv

#### Mac OS X Setup

Installing the required tools is best managed by [homebrew](http://brew.sh).

To install homebrew:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, to install the required tools:

```
# ruby
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
rbenv install 2.3.1
rbenv rehash
rbenv local 2.3.1
gem install bundler

# git, git-crypt, gnupg
brew install git
brew install git-crypt
brew install gnupg

# direnv
brew install direnv
echo "$(direnv hook bash)" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "$(direnv hook zsh)" >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(direnv hook $SHELL)"

direnv allow <repository-directory>
```

### Running the build

To provision module infrastructure, run tests and then destroy that infrastructure,
execute:

```bash
./go
```

To provision the module contents:

```bash
./go provision:aws[<deployment_identifier>]
```

To destroy the module contents:

```bash
./go destroy:aws[<deployment_identifier>]
```

### Common Tasks

To generate an SSH key pair:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C integration-test@example.com -N '' -f config/secrets/keys/bastion/ssh
```
